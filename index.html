                <div class="col s12 l6">
                    <p>I am a 23 year old Computer Science Major graduated from Eastern Michigan University.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my time coding I have worked with various languages and frameworks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col s12 l6">
                    <h5>Some of my projects...</h5>
                    <p>My first big project I worked on was a college football management game written in Java and JavaFX. It was a ui based simulation game with hundereds of teams, you could simulate infinite games and seasons, each game was simulated play
                        by play. This was built while I was learning Java.</p>
                    <p>This idea brought me to my next project. Similar to the previous it was a basketball based simulation game, written in React Native for a cross platform mobile experience. This was much more refined then my first project and actually
                        expanded into 3 separate apps simulating basketball, football and hockey these apps have recieved hundereds of downloads on the app store and google play stores</p>
                    <p>Though I think the app was very impressive making rosters for the app was also a fun hobby for me. But as a coder I knew I didn't want to just sit there plugging in various player info and ratings into excel for the game. I created
                        a converter that uses real life information and statistics, when the application runs it scrapes this data from the web, converts the data into usable information and ratings for the game and exports a pretty JSON file which can
                        be directly imported to the game. This converter originally was written in Python but eventually I made a better version in JavaScript using Node.JS</p>
                    <p>My last semester here at EMU, I realized in order to graduate I would have to do an independent study, for my independent study I linked up with a professor who was in need of a web developer to build his friend's business a website.
                        I was able to build out the front end and back end of the website using technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and mySQL. For the design of the website I used Google's Materialize CSS which gave the design a much cleaner
                        look and saved me a lot of time. </p>
                    <p>Those are some of the major projects I have worked on. I also have probably hundereds of various little things I have written such as Games in C# and Unity, Apps using Android and Java (Still want to learn Kotlin), I have written various
                        web apps using React, dabbled in Angular for a little bit. I spend a lot of my free time doing Udemy Courses which help me tremendously with my skills as a developer.</p>
