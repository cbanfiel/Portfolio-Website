                <h1>On Paper Sports Series</h1>
                <p>Languages/Frameworks: JavaScript/React Native</p>
                <p>On Paper Sports is a GM Game written in React Native, the series has received hundereds of downloads on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. This is by far the largest project I have built.
                </p>
                  <p>The series is 3 separate games simulating different sports. On Paper Sports Basketball '20, On Paper Sports Football '20 and On Paper Sports Hockey '20</p>
                  <p>The games allow a user to control a team and simulate various seasons with that team. It gives you complete control of the team, including trading, free agency, off-season, draft and various other abilities to build your team. There is also a college mode in which a user will have to recruit players to join there team.</p>
                    <p>The game also allows for custom rosters to be loaded in. I love making rosters for the game as a hobby and have also written a web scraper for the app written in Node.JS that scrapes the web for player information and stats and converts that information into usable ratings for the game.</p>

                <h1>Make Me A Drink App</h1>
                <p>Languages/Frameworks: JavaScript/React Native</p>
                <p>After building out such a logic intensive game as the On Paper Sports series I wanted to create something very simplistic. The Make Me A Drink app uses an online cocktail database's API for recipes and images. The app provides the user with a very simplistic and beautiful design</p>
                <p>A drink is randomly shown to the user on a card, that can be flipped over to see the recipe for the said drink. The user can also favorite a drink and view a favorites list. When a new drink is grabbed the current card slides to the left of the screen and a new card slides in from the right</p>

                <h1>COVID-19 Michigan Predictions</h1>
                <p>Languages/Frameworks: Python/Flask and HTML/CSS</p>
                <p>This web application was written using Flask which is a web framework for python. For a group project in class my group collected case and death information daily on COVID-19. This data was grabbed via a web scraper and saved to a SQL database. My job was to use this data in a meaningful way</p>
                <p>I decided it would be neat to predict the spread of COVID-19. The data was collected county by county so I figured it would be neat to predict the growth unique to each county. The application takes in this specific data and using simple mathematical formulas comes up with a growth curve.</p>
                <p>The app takes into account the predicted length of the first wave of COVID-19 as well as the predicted peak day of new cases. These numbers can be changed by a user on the web app.</p>
                <p>The web app was then built to display these numbers in a meaningful way using HTML tables and Chart.JS</p>

                <p>Languages/Frameworks: HTML/CSS and PHP/MySQL</p>

                <p>For my independent study at Eastern Michigan. I was tasked with making a website for a company that wanted to deliver a streaming application for there video training series.</p>
                <p>I did the entire full-stack for the website. Which included setting up the database and working with it in PHP. Also setting up and using a payment API so that users could buy individual training videos.</p>

                <h1>Java College Football Game</h1>
                <p>This was my very first project that I worked on. It is what inspired the On Paper Sports Series. Using Java and JavaFX as the UI. I built out a full college football GM game much like what On Paper Sports Football '20 is. This was the first project that really made me enjoy coding.</p>
